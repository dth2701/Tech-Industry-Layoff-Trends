## Tech Industry Layoff Trends

For this project, I chose the "Technology Company Layoffs (2022-2023)" dataset. 
As an undergraduate passionate about software engineering, my goal is to use data analysis to assist peers who share my career interest in navigating the job market more effectively. Recognizing that 'software engineer' is a broad term across various industries, this analysis aims to highlight specific industry and location trends. A focused approach could enhance job application strategies and resume targeting, proving beneficial in the long-term career planning.
